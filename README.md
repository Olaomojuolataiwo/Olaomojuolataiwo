## 🚀 About Me  
I specialise in building and securing decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols using Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. With a passion for adversarial testing and exploit mitigating design, I leverage tools such as Foundry, Hardhat, Python orchestration, and live testnet deployment to deliver robust blockchain solutions.

## 📌 Featured Projects  
| Project | Description | Highlights |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Commit-Reveal Auction** | Research-driven sealed-bid auction series exploring commit/reveal mechanics, MEV sand-wich attacks and hardened architecture. | On-chain Sepolia ecosystem, adversarial simulations, Python & Foundry automation |
| **Merkle Airdrop (Foundry)** | Implementation of gas-efficient token distribution using Merkle trees, with full test coverage and simulation via Foundry. | Solidity 0.8.x, forked chain tests, clean folder structure |
| **Reentrancy Exploit & Mitigation Demo** | Hands-on demonstration of a reentrancy vulnerability and secure design refactor — inclusive of tests, docs and mitigation patterns. | Solidity, Foundry, security-first design philosophy |

---

## 🛠 Skills & Tooling  
- **Languages:** Solidity (0.8.x), Python (3.x), Bash  
- **Blockchain Tools:** Foundry, Forge, Cast, Hardhat  
- **Security Focus:** Smart contract audits, MEV scenarios, commit/reveal mechanics, refund/griefing defenses, re-org resilience  
- **DevOps & EVM:** Sepolia testnet, Infura/Alchemy RPC, Flashbots simulation fallback, Anvil/ethertester for local forks  
- **CI/Workflow:** GitHub Actions, Scripted orchestration, JSON broadcast logs, clean artifact management  

---

## 🎯 What I Bring to the Table  
- Ability to **design secure DeFi primitives** (e.g., sealed-bid auctions) and test them under adversarial conditions.  
- Proven track record of **audit-grade thinking**: identifying vulnerability vectors, refactoring to hardened patterns, and validating via live deployments.  
- Strong communicator who can turn complex security research into **clear documentation** and tooling for teams.
